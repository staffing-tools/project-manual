.Summary
****
This document describes the motivations, context and objectives concerning the development of an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system[Applicant Tracking System (ATS)]. The aim is to constrain the project scope to some well defined viable solution. 

An ATS help serve the staffing needs of organizations through its role as a repository for job applicants. The most common forms are proprietary works often as a sub-component of some larger ERP system. However, they are not novel and even exist as open source solutions--this would be yet another solution.
